•	**How can I measure the performance of my model?**

-> These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's performance and help in evaluating its strengths and weaknesses, guiding model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and making informed decisions about model deployment.

For the classification models:
1. **Accuracy**: The overall accuracy of the model, which measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model over the total number of instances.
2. **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix that provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
3. **Precision**: The ratio of true positive instances among the instances predicted as positive by the model.
4. **Recall**: The proportion of true positive instances that were correctly predicted as positive by the model.
5. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.
6. **ROC and AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various classification thresholds. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances.
7. **Log Loss**: A metric that measures the performance of the classification model by penalizing false classifications based on their confidence level.

For the regression models:
1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.
2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the MSE, which provides the same units as the target variable, making it easier to interpret.
3. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.
4. **R-squared (R²)**: A statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
5. **Adjusted R-squared**: A modified version of R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more reliable measure of the model's goodness of fit.

The choice of metric(s) depends on the specific problem, the nature of the data, and the relative importance of different aspects of the model's performance, such as sensitivity to outliers or interpretability of the metric.


•	**What are: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall & F1 Score, ROC & AUC, Log Loss?**

-> These terms are briefly explained as follows:
1. **Accuracy**: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions made by the model to the total number of instances. Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / (True Positives + True Negatives + False Positives + False Negatives).
2. **Confusion Matrix**: It is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
3. **Precision**: It is the ratio of true positives to the total number of instances predicted as positive by the model. Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).
4. **Recall**: It is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positive instances. Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives).
5. **F1 Score**: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance. F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall).
6. **ROC and AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot of the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various classification thresholds. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 represents a random classifier.
7. **Log Loss**: It is a metric that measures the performance of a classification model by penalizing false classifications based on their confidence level. The log loss is calculated as the negative log-likelihood of the true class labels given the predicted probabilities. Lower values of log loss indicate better model performance.

Regardless of the model type, these metrics serve as valuable tools for evaluating model performance, identifying areas for improvement, and making informed decisions during the model selection and deployment processes. They help data scientists and analysts choose the most appropriate model for their specific problem and data characteristics, fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance, and ultimately deploy models that meet the desired criteria for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.
